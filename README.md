# SOWISO developer assignment

From a software engineering perspective, the core of SOWISO is to generate exercises, display them in a browser, capture the answer, evaluate the answer and give feedback on it. This assignment is to simulate that process.
## Goal
The goal is to make an exercise of the type ​a ​+ b​ ​where both ​a ​and​ b ​are random numbers. The end user gets this exercise presented in a web browser and can submit an answer. The answer should somehow be evaluated, telling the user whether it was correct.
## Software
You are free to use whatever language, techniques and libraries you want, just make sure you have a good explanation for it.
## Time
We expect it will take you approximately 2 hours to get this done, but there is no restriction on time.
## Code
Please upload your code to gitlab/github or somewhere else and share it with us prior to the meeting.
